You're on the right track, and what you’re describing is a modern, reproducible, cost-aware data analytics pipeline. Let's refine and structure it step-by-step to ensure it's robust, automatable, and production-ready.
🧠 Your High-Level Plan (Refined)

Here’s your concept, revised into a clean, reliable pipeline:
1. Daily Extraction: BigQuery → Parquet or DuckDB

    Run daily query jobs to extract data from BigQuery

    Save to compressed Parquet (e.g., gzip, snappy) or .duckdb

    Store locally (for dev) and/or push to:

        Google Cloud Storage (for backup + reproducibility)

        Optionally commit small files to GitHub (via DVC or Git LFS)

2. Versioned Storage & Tracking: DVC

    Use DVC to:

        Track changes to the data files

        Push data to GCS remote storage

        Link data version to specific code/report commits

    Avoid storing large files directly in GitHub

3. Local Analysis with DuckDB

    Load Parquet or .duckdb into DuckDB

    Join, filter, explore locally without re-querying BigQuery

    Optionally define logic in dbt-duckdb if models become complex

4. Reporting with Evidence

    Connect Evidence to .duckdb or query read_parquet() directly

    Build SQL+Markdown reports with variables and filters

    Version all reports and data models in Git

5. Deployment to GCP (Optional Automation/Serving)

    Trigger daily jobs (BQ → Parquet → GCS) via:

        Cloud Functions

        Cloud Scheduler + Cloud Run / Composer

    Host Evidence:

        Deploy to Cloud Run (good for lightweight services)

        Store static reports to Cloud Storage + CDN (if pre-rendered)

        Use GitHub Actions to regenerate + deploy reports on push

✅ Revised Pipeline (with Tech Choices)
🔄 Ingestion + Transformation
Step	Tool	Notes
Query BigQuery	google-cloud-bigquery, SQL	Use parameterized queries, incremental filters (e.g., WHERE date > @last_day)
Save Locally	pandas.to_parquet() or duckdb.register()	Save to data/ folder
Version Data	DVC	Store metadata in Git, push data to GCS
🔍 Analysis
Step	Tool	Notes
Explore / Join / Filter	DuckDB	Fast, local SQL
Optional Modeling	dbt-duckdb	Structured SQL transformations, testable
📊 Reporting
Step	Tool	Notes
Report Development	Evidence.dev	Markdown + SQL, supports DuckDB
Data Source	.duckdb file or read_parquet()	Load from data/ directory tracked by DVC
☁️ Deployment
Step	Tool	Notes
Automate Daily Jobs	Cloud Scheduler → Cloud Run / Function	Call Python script to re-query and re-save
Upload to GCS	gsutil, dvc push	Store .parquet or .duckdb snapshots
Deploy Reports	Cloud Run / Static Hosting	Deploy full Evidence app or static HTML exports
CI/CD	GitHub Actions	Auto-run pipeline, push reports, update storage
🧩 Optional Enhancements

    Dagster or Prefect instead of scripts for orchestration (nicer logs, retries, visual flow)

    Great Expectations or Evidently to validate output before reporting

    GCS Lifecycle Policies to auto-delete old data

    FastAPI + Evidence hybrid for interactive dashboards
